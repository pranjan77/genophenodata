## SDK and Science Target Functionality - post GWAS functional analysis

### Summary
The methods in this service will help users to explore Genomewide association analysis results, multiple ways to visualize the results, integrate with omics datasets, expedite data mining and aid hypotheses building.

### Story/Description 
Genome wide association analysis (GWAS) identifies statistically significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to phenotype / trait of interest. Post GWAS analyses which is going from list of SNPs to a more complete biological story is a major bottleneck. Most of these analysis require manual data extraction and integration with other data types including expression data and pathway data. Just sharing of this dataset is a big challenge for the community. The methods in the service will help users to explore GWAS datasets, multiple ways to visualize the results, integrate with omics datasets, expedite data mining and aid hypotheses building.

GWAS populations and thousands of population level measurements are available for various plant species including Arabidopsis, Populus, Medicago, Sorghum, Maize, Soybean, Foxtail millet, Rice, Switchgrass etc. It is a new functionality and will help us attract researchers interested in statistical genetics possibly leading to citations.
