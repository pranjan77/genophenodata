Genome wide association analysis identifies statistically significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to phenotype / trait of interest. Post GWAS analyses which is going from list of SNPs to a more complete biological story is a major bottleneck. Most of these analysis require manual data extraction and integration with other data types including expression data and pathway data. Just sharing of this dataset is a big challenge for the community. The methods in the service will help users to explore GWAS datasets, multiple ways to visualize the results, integrate with omics datasets, expedite data mining and aid hypotheses building.
